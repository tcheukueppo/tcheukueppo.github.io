Hello there! you can call me Kueppo though I'm mostly known on the internet as @tcheukueppo
so, call me as such if you really like to. I live in Africa/cameroon.

Just like any geek out there, I spent most of my time writing code and administering open source
operating systems because why not? :).

To know how much I might be of interest to you, see the list of my open source projects
and also checkout my blog because some of the content are quite good.

I'm a polyglot programmer. I dealed with C, Perl, Sh, Go, Rust, Lua, and Python.

I'm helpful on the following topics:

1. Unix & Linux
2. Databases Design and Administration
3. Software Design
4. System Administration
5. Devops
6. Web
7. Video and Audio: Ffmpeg, ImageMagick, and Synfig.
