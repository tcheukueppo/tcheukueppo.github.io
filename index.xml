I live in Africa/cameroon.
Just like any geek out there, I spent most of my time writing code and administering open source operating systems because why not? :).
To know how much I can be of interest to you, see the list of my open source projects and also checkout my blog because some of the content are quite good.
I&amp;rsquo;m a polyglot programmer. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with C, Perl, Sh, Go, Rust, Lua, and Python.</description></item></channel></rss>
